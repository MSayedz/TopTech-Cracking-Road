The Collection interface is the root interface of the Java collections framework.

There is no direct implementation of this interface. However, it is implemented through its subinterfaces like List, Set, and Queue.

For example, the ArrayList class implements the List interface which is a subinterface of the Collection Interface.

Subinterfaces of Collection
As mentioned above, the Collection interface includes subinterfaces that are implemented by various classes in Java.

1. List Interface

The List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to add and remove elements like an array.

2. Set Interface
The Set interface allows us to store elements in different sets similar to the set in mathematics. It cannot have duplicate elements.

3. Queue Interface
The Queue interface is used when we want to store and access elements in First In, First Out(FIFO) manner.
