# Java Methods:

## Methods of Collection
The Collection interface includes various methods that can be used to perform different operations on objects. These methods are available in all its subinterfaces.

      add() - inserts the specified element to the collection
      remove() - removes the specified element from the collection
      size() - returns the size of the collection
      iterator() - returns an iterator to access elements of the collection
      addAll() - adds all the elements of a specified collection to the collection
      removeAll() - removes all the elements of the specified collection from the collection
      clear() - removes all the elements of the collection

## Methods of List
The List interface includes all the methods of the Collection interface. Its because Collection is a super interface of List.

Some of the commonly used methods of the Collection interface that's also available in the List interface are:

      get() - helps to randomly access elements from lists
      set() - changes elements of lists
      toArray() - converts a list into an array
      contains() - returns true if a list contains specified element
      
      + Collection Interface Methods 
      add() - adds an element to a list
      addAll() - adds all elements of one list to another
      size() - returns the length of lists
      iterator() - returns iterator object that can be used to sequentially access elements of lists
      remove() - removes an element from the list
      removeAll() - removes all the elements from the list
      clear() - removes all the elements from the list (more efficient than removeAll())
